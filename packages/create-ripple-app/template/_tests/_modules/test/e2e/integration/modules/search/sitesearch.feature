Feature: Search (Site search)

  As a citizen I want to be able to search the site for information I want by keyword

  Scenario: Test search page loads SSR
    Given I am using a "macbook-15" device
    When I visit the page "/search"
    Then the current page should not be an error page

  Scenario: Global site search from header desktop
    Given I have mocked the search request with fixture "modules/search/sitesearch" and params "from=0&size=10&filter_path=hits.hits,hits.total,aggregations&_source=changed,created,field_landing_page_summary,field_node_primary_site,field_page_intro_text,field_tags_name,field_topic_name,summary_processed,title,type,url"
    Given I have mocked the search request with fixture "modules/search/sitesearch-filters" and params "size=0"
    Given I am using a "macbook-15" device
    When I visit the page "/"
    Then the search button in the site header should exist
    Then the search button in the site header should have the text "Search website"
    When I scroll to the "top" of the page
    And I click the search button in the site header
    Then the site search box should be visible
    Then the site search box should have the placeholder "Start typing..."
    When I type "victoria" into the site search input and hit enter
    Then I should be on the page "/search?q=victoria"
    And the current page should not be an error page
    Then there should be "10 of 577" search results
    And there should be the following search results:
