## What is it?

The Ripple design system consists of the design elements and components used to build _any_ web application using the Victorian government brand. Ripple _framework_ is a collection of [Nuxt 3](2.key-concepts/1.nuxt.md) modules and [layers](2.key-concepts/2.nuxt-layers.md) primarily used to create headless SDP websites using the Tide Drupal CMS.

## Who's it for?

Whilst the Ripple UI components can be used in non SDP projects, Ripple framework assumes a Tide Drupal backend in most cases. 

Using the Ripple framework, developers are able to build headless frontend websites that derive content from the Tide Drupal CMS via it's JSON API.
