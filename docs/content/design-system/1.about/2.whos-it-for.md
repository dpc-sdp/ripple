Ripple is built to help deliver websites to deliver government information to Victorian citizens. It is primarily used by Victorian government departments and agencies through the [SDP program](https://www.vic.gov.au/single-digital-presence). 

Ripple is designed to make it easy to communicate government information in a clear, concise and accessible manner for all Victorians. It is solely used to represent the Victorian government brand in digital products and services.

> Ripple is intended for Victorian government branded products only, and should only be used to produce approved Victorian government branded communications.

As the system is intended to be modular, it is possible to opt into various parts of the system. For example projects not on SDP can adopt the design into their own digital products, either by building their own components, referencing our styles or importing our components. See the [Usage page](../3.develop/3.usage.md) for more information. If you are site using or wanting to use Ripple in a non SDP project please get in [touch with us](3.getting-support.md) to see how we can support your project.
