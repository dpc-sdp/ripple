## Usage
Use tags to help categorise content. Tags help users to scan and find content that's relevant to them.

Content can have more than one category or theme. Using the tag component helps indicate this to the user.

When naming tags, use a noun or adjective. Don't use verbs as a user may confuse the tag with an action.
