## Usage

Use a category grid to help users browse a range of categories and content. Each card in a collection acts as a link to more information.

A category grid uses the text link style to indicate clickable elements. An accompanying media item, such as an icon or pictogram, is used to support the content for each category.

The media item you choose must be directly relevant to the card’s content, to support and reinforce the user’s understanding. The icon or pictogram should clearly show the difference in topics and should be easily identifiable.
