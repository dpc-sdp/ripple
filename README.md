## About the project

Ripple is the design system for Victorian government digital products.

Ripple is a system of reusable styles, components, patterns and tools for building brand Victoria digital products. Ripple strives to:

- make it easier for citizens to find, understand and use government information
- ensure users can easily navigate sites regardless of technical ability, location or device
- allow designers and developers to create consistent Brand Victoria digital products
- increase the speed of delivery for digital products and services

Over 50 government websites use Ripple to date, including our main vic.gov.au platform.

Ripple 2 is a complete re-write of the Ripple design system and was developed and maintained by the [Single Digital Presence](https://www.vic.gov.au/single-digital-presence) team within the Department of Government Services.


## Usage

Ripple is specifically designed to meet the purposes of Victoria Government websites meeting [Brand Victoria](https://www.vic.gov.au/brand-victoria-guidelines) guidelines. 
Usage on non Victorian Government approved websites is not recommended and is unsupported.
