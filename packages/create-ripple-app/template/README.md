## Development Guide

Basically, custom dev work only happens in two files:

- [assets/_custom.scss](assets/_custom.scss)

For more Ripple document, please check [https://github.com/dpc-sdp/ripple/](https://github.com/dpc-sdp/ripple/blob/production/README.md).

### Custom variables

We are using Ripple pattern library [https://ripple.sdp.vic.gov.au/](https://ripple.sdp.vic.gov.au/) in this project.

You can orveride [Ripple](https://github.com/dpc-sdp/ripple) scss variables in
[assets/_theme.scss](assets/_theme.scss) such as colour.

Currently all scss variables with `!default` in Ripple can be overridden.
We will build a guide of variables in future. But for now, you can check [Ripple packages](https://github.com/dpc-sdp/ripple/blob/master/packages/components) scss files if you want to go deep.

### Custom scss

You can overide styles in [assets/_custom.scss](assets/_custom.scss) by adding any site specific styles.

### Custom static files

For custom images, favicons, analytics JavaScript files, you can replace them in [static](static) directory.
